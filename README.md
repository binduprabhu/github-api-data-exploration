# 📁 GitHub API Data Project

This repository contains a mini project completed as part of my Master’s program.  
The goal was to explore and analyze public data made available by GitHub using its open API.

GitHub is a widely used version control platform that hosts millions of public and private code repositories. It provides a RESTful API that allows developers to access repository metadata, commits, user activity, and more — in real time.

In this project, I used Python to connect to the GitHub HTTP API, retrieve live data (in JSON format), and process it using built-in and open-source libraries. The retrieved data is analyzed and visualized to understand GitHub activity patterns such as:

- Repository creation trends
- Push and commit activity
- Top users or repos by traffic
- Event types (Forks, Issues, Stars, etc.)

Some aspects were further explored using datasets from **GH Archive**, a project that stores a record of GitHub's public events and makes it available via Google BigQuery.
